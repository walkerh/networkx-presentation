**Title:** Finding Meaning in Connections: A Practical Demo with NetworkX

**Speaker:** Walker Hale

**Description:** How do you analyze a dataset when its structure only makes sense as a web of interconnected events? In this talk, we’ll walk through a real-world (but redacted) example where traditional approaches failed—and where the Python library NetworkX offered a breakthrough. You'll see how graph-based analysis made it possible to identify clusters, uncover hidden structure, and extract actionable insights from seemingly chaotic data. No theory, just practical application.
